Every now and then when I am coding I run into a problem that takes some time to solve. After spending a couple of hours working out a solution I often find myself wishing that I had some way to share the solution with others that might run into the same problem. It also happens that I sometimes forget how I solved a specific problem, forcing me to reinvent the wheel again.

But no more! This blog is born with the purpose to document things I might otherwise forget, and maybe save others some work too. Take note: as I refine my solutions I might go back and edit old posts to keep them updated with how I solve certain problems.
